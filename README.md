# Temp-Converter
A simple app that lets users convert the temperature in Fahrenheit, Celcius, and Kelvin. This app utilizes HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and VanillaJS. This was inspired by Traversy Media's weight converter which can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l-ZAuU8TXc&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX&index=4). Live version of the app can be viewed [here](http://ike-temp-converter.surge.sh/).
